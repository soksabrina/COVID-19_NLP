# COVID-19_NLP

The rise of Coronavirus across the globe is a concern for many. The aim of this analysis is to provide some insights to the journals being published about Coronavirus. Below you will find information on the most published journals and the common words amongst the journals. This is also a personal project in an attempt to practice my skills on data visualization and on NLP.

Insights:<br>
The LDA model predicted two categories of topic. The first consists of words like "virus", "cell", "protein", "infection", "viral", "gene", and is most likely to related to experimental type of work (perhaps these journals were published after lab experiments and data analysis of results collected from the experiments). The second topic consists of words "patient", "disease", "health", "respiratory", "infection", "study", and seem to most likely relate to observational type of studies (perhaps these journals were published as a result of analysis done on data collected from hospitals or any sort of health care institutions).
